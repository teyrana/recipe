Mexican Rice

Ingredients:

- 2C of long-grain rice
- 4C of chicken broth
- 12 C of tomato sauce or 3 fresh Roma tomatoes, blended
- 1medium white onion, diced
- 3cloves of garlic, minced
- 2t cumin
- 2t garlic powder
- 2t salt
- 12 teaspoon black pepper
- 1cup of peas and carrots, defrosted
Chopped cilantro, optional
Olive oil or canola oil

## Directions:

1. In a large pan, heat 3 tablespoons of oil to medium heat, add the rice and saute for a few minutes until the rice becomes aromatic and slightly opaque. Add the onions and the garlic and cook for just 1 minute. Add all the dry spices and stir well to combine. Add the tomato sauce and broth, stir well and taste for salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 10 minutes without disturbing the rice.

2. Add the peas and carrots evenly to the top of the rice. Cover and continue cooking until all of the liquid has evaporated. Total cooking time is about 20 minutes or so. (If rice doesn't look like it is cooking evenly, gently stir with a fork and add 2 to 3 tablespoons of broth or water, cover and continue cooking.)

3. Remove from heat once liquid has evaporated and let stand for 10 minutes. When ready to serve, fluff with a fork and fold in the fresh cilantro if using. Yields up to 10 servings.
