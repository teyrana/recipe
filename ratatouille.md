# Summer Vegetable Ratatouille

- 8 Servings

## Ingredients:
- 2 white onion, sliced into rings
- 2 zucchini, sliced (5mm)
- 2 medium yellow squash, sliced (5mm)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 Sweet Peppers (red), sliced into 1cm strips
- 1 medium eggplant
- 4 roma (plum) tomatoes, cubed
- 1/2 cup olive oil
  
- 2 bay leaves
- 3 t rosemary
- 6 t fresh thyme
- salt and pepper to taste


## Directions: Simple:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
   
2. Coat bottom and sides of a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
3. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic until lightly browned. Mix in parsley and eggplant. Cook and stir until eggplant is soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt to taste.
4. Spread eggplant mixture evenly across bottom of prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese. Spread zucchini in an even layer over top. Lightly salt and sprinkle with a little more cheese. Continue layering in this fashion, with onion, mushrooms, bell pepper, and tomatoes, covering each layer with a sprinkling of salt and cheese.
5. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.

## Directions: Fancy:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

2. Place the eggplant in a colander and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Set aside for 20 minutes to drain. Blot dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.

3. Slice and cube: Garlic, Zucchini, Yellow Squash, and Sweet Peppers.

4. Cut eggplant into 1-inch cubes or spears.

5. Spread each vegetable on baking sheets:
- smashed garlic & onion pan + 1 t rosemary, 2 t thyme, sprinkle of salt, drizzle Olive Oil
- peppers + 1 t rosemary, 2 t thyme, sprinkle of salt, drizzle Olive Oil
- eggplant and zucchini + 1 t rosemary, 2 t thyme, sprinkle of salt, drizzle Olive Oil

6. Place all the pans in the oven (or work in batches if they don’t fit at once). Cook until vegetables are very tender and lightly browned at the edges. This will take:
- about 35 to 40 minutes for the peppers (their skins should shrivel)-
- 40 to 45 minutes for the eggplant and zucchini (the eggplant should crisp slightly and the zucchini should be well cooked, so let them go 3 to 5 minutes longer than you normally might)
- 60 to 65 minutes for the onions. Don’t worry about the vegetables being pretty; they will meld into the ratatouille.

Shake or stir the pans every 15 to 20 minutes or so, especially the onions.

7. Cube Tomatoes, and combine with a sprinkle of salt & bay leaves

8. Once vegetables are done cooking, combine with tomatoes in a large shallow baking dish.
  
9. Cover generously with olive oil, using remaining 1/4 cup oil, and sprinkle with salt. 

10. Cook at least 1 hour, stirring every 15 to 20 minutes, until vegetables are very tender and imbued with juices and oil.

11. Add salt and pepper to taste, then serve warm, or let cool.
