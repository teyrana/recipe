    1 cup all-purpose flour
    2 teaspoons baking powder
    1 three finger pinch salt
    2 teaspoons sugar
    3/4 - 1 cup milk
    1 egg
    2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled
    Some more butter for the pan

Note: These are a bit bland works fine as a base, but may need spices, fruit, etc.


Melt the butter (30 seconds on a medium setting in the microwave is about right) and let it start to cool. Combine the dry ingredients in a good sized bowl and stir a few times to distribute. In a separate bowl, beat the egg into the milk with a fork, then add the melted butter. Start with a little less milk; you can always add more if the batter is too thick.

By mixing the wet and dry ingredients separately, you make sure that the wet ingredients are mixed properly without overworking the batter. Now, combine the wet ingredients with the dry and mix until the batter just comes together  dont over mix, its ok if the batter is still lumpy.

While the batter is resting, heat your griddle on medium heat.

Pancake batter is wonderful because its so variable. You can replace half the flour with whole wheat flour or other grains like cooked cornmeal or whole oats. You can stir in a little spice like cinnamon or add fresh blueberries or thinly sliced bananas once you ladle the batter but before you flip the cakes. Try separating the egg(s), beat the yolks as usual then whip the whites with a handmixer and fold them into the combined batter. Zest some lemon or orange peel into the batter to brighten it up. You can even add chocolate chips if youre feeling indulgent.
