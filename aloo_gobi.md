# Aloo Gobi


Aloo gobi is an Indian dish made of spiced cauliflower and potatoes. This recipe is steamed and then fried in oil, making it intentionally dry and somewhat crispy. Warning: This dish is extremely spicy, which is the way I like it. However, if you don't want your food that spicy, feel free to cut down on the serrano pepper, cayenne pepper, or both. Also, I recommend serving this with a side of raita or plain yogurt to cool the mouth down after eating.
