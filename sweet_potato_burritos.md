# Sweet Potato Burritos

NOT FINAL--
These are tasty, but need some refinement--
 (1) try black beans instead of kidney
 (2) the sweet potatoes need cook-until-mush, but probably don't need to be mashed.  Try Potato-fry type preparation...
 (3) fee free to skimp on the extra water...  Burritos need filling, not sauce
 (4) more spice (chili & cayenne)
