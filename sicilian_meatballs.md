Family Sicilian Sauce and Meatballs

Makes 24 servings  

      " My Mother's family originally came from Sicily and every family member makes his or her own version - this version came most recently via Brooklyn. Use your favorite meat and Italian red wine for this sauce and serve with your favorite pasta. This also is a great pizza sauce if you leave out about half of the meat. If there are any leftovers, they freeze very well. MANGIA! "
