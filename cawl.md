Cawl (Traditional Welsh Broth)
"The recipe that follows is one that is popular with, and derived from,
the local farming community of Cardiganshire. There are regional
variations throughout Wales as to what meat is used; some use Pork
or Mutton we use Shin Beef. The quantities used here are based on
my own requirements for two to three days, as this soup is one that
improves on subsequent re-heating. Serve with lightly buttered bread
and a good mature Cheddar cheese"
