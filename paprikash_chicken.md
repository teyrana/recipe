Chicken Paprikash

Serves: 2

Paprikash: the classic Hungarian stew of onions, peppers, and meteorological quantities of paprika, tamed with sour cream. Let us begin:

- 12 roasted chicken
- 1bell pepper, chopped
- 1large, Hungarian-sized onion, thinly sliced
- 12 C dry white wine (e.g. Sauvignon Blanc)
- 1C tomatoes, diced, No juice necessary
    * 1-2 T sour cream
- 10T sweet paprika
- 1T flour
    * Marjoram and fresh parsley to taste
    * Buttered egg noodles or spaetzle, or dumplings, or bread, or other starch


Preheat oven to 300 deg

Pull as much meat off the bone as you can. Don't be afraid to just go in with your hands - whole chickens aren't the most fork-and-knife-friendly affair. If there's any skin or fat, set that aside separately and mince it. Chop or tear the meat into bite-size pieces. You should have three bowls of chicken now: meat, skin & fat, and juices.

[alt: sear chicken here, then set aside]

Start with vegetable oil in a heavy, oven-safe saucepan or dutch oven over medium to medium-high heat. Add onions, chicken skin, and chicken fat (adjust amount of vegetable oil depending on how much fat you have.) Cook 3-5 minutes until the onions are soft and the chicken pieces crisp up a bit. Add the bell pepper and cook for another 2-3 minutes.

In a small bowl combine the flour and about 2/3 of the paprika. Add to the pan and stir for a minute; it'll be dry and brown and you might get scared, but don't worry. After a minute you'll add the wine and tomato, and you'll scrape the bottom and sides of the pot. Everything should start getting together now, the solids dissolving in the liquid. Add the marjoram and pour in any chicken juices you might have collected earlier. Salt a little; it's usually a good idea to salt as you go, remembering that as liquids evaporate, the saltiness of the whole dish will increase.

Cover the pot and place it in the oven for 15-20 minutes. When the stew looks thickened and almost ready, add the chopped chicken and cook on the stove over medium heat for another few minutes until the chicken is warm. Taste and add salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper (or other heat source) to taste. 

Stir the rest of the paprika into the sour cream, then fold this into the stew until smooth. Plate your starch (noodles, bread) and spoon the paprikash over it. Sprinkle with parsley and you're done.


I like two different styles of sour cream: a) smooth, sweet, and milky, b) thick and tart.  I find that the smoother cream curdles less and tames better.
