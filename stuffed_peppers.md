Cook Time: 2 Hours 30 Minutes
Ready In: 3 Hours

## Ingredients:
- 8 large green bell peppers
- 6 T butter
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 11/2 pounds ground round salt to taste ground black pepper to taste
- 1 C uncooked white rice
- 1 gallon tomato juice    

## Directions:
1. Wash the peppers thoroughly. Make a circular incision around the stem to remove it.
Once stem has been removed, remove seeds, and rinse the inside of the pepper.
2. Discard seeds and stems and set peppers aside.
3. In a skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and saute onion until translucent.
4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the onion and butter mixture with the ground beef
and mix well by hand. Sprinkle in salt and pepper to taste.
Slowly pour in the rice, while mixing by hand. Mix thoroughly.
5. Stuff the meat and rice mixture into the peppers.
6. Coat the bottom of 1 or 2 large pots with oil. Place the stuffed peppers into the
pot(s) leaving a 2 inch space at the top of the pot. Pour in tomato juice until peppers
are covered. If there is leftover meat mixture, form into balls and add to the tomato juice.
5. Heat on low for 2 to 3 hours. Stir every 20 to 45 minutes. Juice will reduce to
a thick sauce. You can tell that the peppers are done when they are splitting at the sides.
