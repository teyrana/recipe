# Watermelon, Feta, and Mint Salad

- Prep 10 mins
- Active 5 mins
- Total 15 mins
- Serves 4 to 6 servings


## Ingredients

- 2 lb watermelon, cubed
- 1 T (15 ml) lime juice
- 1/4 C (10 g) roughly chopped fresh mint leaves
- 3 T (45 ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- [optional] 1 qt arugula leaves
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 ounces (110 g) feta cheese (see note)
    This dish greatly depends on the quality of the feta. If you have options at your supermarket, look for true Greek or Bulgarian sheep's milk feta, which tends to be
    creamier and tangier than domestic cow's-milk versions.
    To make this salad more substantial, add arugula.

1. Place watermelon chunks in a large bowl.
2. Add lime juice Add mint, oil, [and arugula (if using)]
3. Toss until watermelon is evenly dressed.
4. Season lightly to taste with salt and pepper.
5. Crumble feta over top.
6. Drizzle with more olive oil and a few grinds of black pepper.
7. Serve immediately.
