Sadies kale salad

Serves: 4-6

INGREDIENTS:
- 1bunch of kale
- 14 cup good olive oil (4 tbsp.)
- 4tsp. lemon juice
- 2tsp. shallots, diced
- 12 cup aged gouda, grated
- 14 cup golden raisins
- 14 cup pine nuts, toasted
Kosher salt and pepper to taste


1. Heat a small pan on medium-low and slowly toast the pine nuts, about 4 to 6 minutes, shaking occasionally. Keep an eye on them as they will burn quickly.
2. Add the diced shallots to a small bowl with a pinch of salt, and lemon juice. Mix with a fork to combine.
3. Slowly pour a thin stream of olive oil into the shallot/lemon juice while whisking to emulsify the dressing.
4. Separate the kale leaves from the tough stems. Chiffonade the leaves by stacking 4 to 5 at a time, rolling them tightly, then cutting them into thin slices.
5. Add the leaves to a large mixing bowl, whisk the dressing again, slowly pour about 2/3 of the dressing around the edge of the bowl then mix the salad. Add more dressing if it seems dry.
6. Add about 1/2 of the grated cheese, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of fresh pepper to the salad, mix to combine, then repeat.
7. Add half the raisins and toasted nuts, turn once, then top with the remaining. Alternatively, plate the salad before adding the raisins and nuts then dole those out individually.
