# Indian SaagIndian saag is a curry of cooked mustard or similar 'bitter' greens (kale, collards, turnip greens), and spinach or similar mild greens (chard, bok choy, beet greens). Any combination of greens works! Use more spices and peppers for hot saag, or less for mild.Prep Time: 30mCook Time: 20mReady In: 50mYield 3 cups## Ingredients:-1/2 cup butter-2 teaspoons cumin seed-1 green chile pepper, seeded and diced-2 cloves garlic, chopped-2 tablespoons ground turmeric-1 pound chopped fresh mustard greens-1 pound chopped fresh spinach-1 teaspoon ground cumin-1 teaspoon ground coriander-1 teaspoon salt## Directions:1.
