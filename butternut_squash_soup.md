6 servings

## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 onion, diced
- 3/4 cup diced carrots (cut fine/blended)
- 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
- 1 jalapeno pepper [1 t cayenne pepper powder)
- 1 (2 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed
- 15 oz vegetable broth
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
    salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste
    [2 stalk celery]


## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place squash, cut sides down, in a 9x13 baking dish. Pour water into dish around squash halves.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until tender and easily pierced with a fork, about 1 1/2 hours. Carefully remove the skin with a fork; it should be very easy to remove.


1. Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat.
2. Stir in the onion, ginger, and jalapeno pepper.
3. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 7 minutes.

Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the squash is tender, about 30 minutes.
Stir in the milk, salt and pepper.
Cook and stir 5 minutes more.
Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full.
Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth, and pour into a clean pot.
   [Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot. ]
Ladle into bowls, and garnish with sour cream and thyme to serve.
