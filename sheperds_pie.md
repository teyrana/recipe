## Ingredients

### Mashed Potato Ingredients

- 1 T butter


### Stuffing Ingredients
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 lb lean ground beef | lamb
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 t minced fresh rosemary
- 1 t paprika
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 T ketchup
- 3 cl garlic, minced

??    2.5 cups water, or as needed
- 12 oz peas and carrots, diced
- 2.5 pounds potatoes, peeled and halved
- 1 T butter
- 1 pinch ground cayenne pepper
- 1/4 pound Irish cheese (such as Dubliner), shredded
- 2 T milk


## Directions:
   
1. Heat 1 T butter or oil in a medium saucepan, then soften 1 chopped onion and 2-3 chopped carrots for a few mins.
2. When soft, turn up the heat, crumble in 500g lamb mince and brown, tipping off any excess fat.
3. [Add 2 tbsp tomato pur√©e] and a large splash of Worcestershire sauce, then fry for a few mins.
4. Pour over 500ml beef stock, bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for 40 mins, uncovering halfway.
5. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4, then make the mash. Boil the 900g potato, cut into chunks, in salted water for 10-15 mins until tender. Drain, then mash with 85g butter and 3 tbsp milk.
6. Put the mince into an ovenproof dish, top with the mash and ruffle with a fork. The pie can now be chilled and frozen for up to a month.
7. Bake for 20-25 mins until the top is starting to colour and the mince is bubbling through at the edges. (To bake from frozen, cook at 160C/fan 140C/gas 3 for 1 hr-1 hr 20 mins until piping hot in the centre. Flash under the grill to brown, if you like.)
8. Leave to stand for 5 mins before serving.
