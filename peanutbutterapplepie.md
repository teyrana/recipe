Prep Time      20 minutes
Cook Time      45 minutes


Ingredients:

- 1refrigerated pie crust, left at room temperature for 30 minutes (or homemade)
- 4slices large apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/4"(I used Gala apples)
- 34 cup brown sugar, divided
- 13 cup plus 2 tablespoons all purpose flour, divided
- 1teaspoon cinnamon
- 4tablespoon butter, divided
- 14 cup peanut butter
- 34 cup rolled oats
    vanilla ice cream, optional

Instructions:

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Press pie crust into pie pan, trim overhang, and crimp edges. Set aside.
2.  In a large bowl, stir together apple, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 2 tbsp. flour, and cinnamon. Pour apple mixture into pie crust, and gently press down to make the filling somewhat flat. Dot apples with 1 tbsp. of cold butter.
3.  Place peanut butter and 3 tbsp. butter in a medium, microwave-safe bowl. Heat for 30-45 seconds until butter is melted, stirring once during heating. Stir until smooth. Add oats, 1/4 c. brown sugar, and 1/3 c. flour. Stir together, then use your fingers to crumble the peanut butter mixture evenly over the apple filling. (It's OK if it doesn't cover the filling completely.)
4.  Cover the edge of the pie with a
5.  silicone pie ring
6.   or aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until apples are tender and crumb topping is golden brown. Serve warm or cold, preferably with vanilla ice cream.
