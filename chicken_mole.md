# Chicken Mole

Makes 12 enchiladas

## Sauce Ingredients:
3+ T cooking oil (preferably unrefined peanut oil), divided
4 T peanut butter (like JIF)
4 T butter
3-6 cups low-salt chicken broth
1.25 lb onions, sliced, divided
1/2 C sliced almonds
6 cl Garlic, sliced
1 to 2 serrano peppers
3 t cumin seeds
3 t coriander seeds
1 t cinnamon
2 T apple cider vinegar (apple juice?)
2x (4oz) Ancho (dried red/black) / dried poblanos (dried) / pasilla (dried)
2x (cayenne / jalapeno / chipotle)
1/4 C Raisins
2 t Mexican oregano
3 oz (1 disk) Mexican chocolate, chopped (Dark, sweet, grainy-textured chocolate disks flavored with cinnamon)

Sides:
onion, tomato, cilantro, lime, bell peppers (see other recipe)
mexican rice (see other recipe)
chicken enchiladas (see other recipe)


## Sauce Directions:
1. Remove the stems and seeds from dried peppers. Transfer to a glass bowl, cover with water and cook in the microwave for 6 to 7 minutes, stirring once during cooking time. Remove from microwave, cover and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions and saut� until golden brown, about 18 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add almonds, garlic, cumin, cinnamon, and coriander. Saut� until nuts and garlic begin to color, about 2 minutes. Add chiles and stir until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes.

3. Drain all of the liquid from the dried peppers, add them to the pan, along with 4 cups of broth and all of the remaining ingredients, minus the Mexican chocolate. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Remove pan from heat, and transfer the mixture to a blender or high capacity processor. Blend on high until smooth. Be extremely careful when blending hot liquids. Always secure top of blender using a towel, use your hand to hold down lid tightly. Now at this point you can strain the sauce through a wire mesh strainer into a larger bowl, for a really smooth sauce. I have skipped this step a couple of times, but I would say that the strained sauce is my favorite version.

4. In that same pan, heat 3 tablespoons of oil to medium heat. Let it heat for a minute or two. Add the sauce to pan, add the remaining chicken broth, stir well and taste for salt. When it comes to a boil, add the Mexican chocolate and stir until melted

5. Cover, reduce heat and continue cooking and stirring for another 35 to 40 minutes.

DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Chill until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Rewarm over low heat before serving.
