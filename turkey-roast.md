PREP TIME  	10 Min
COOK TIME  	5 Hrs
READY IN  	5 Hrs 10 Min

## Ingredients:
- 1(12 pound) whole turkey
- 6tablespoons butter, divided
- 4cups warm water
- 3tablespoons chicken bouillon
- 2tablespoons dried parsley
- 2tablespoons dried minced onion
- 2tablespoons seasoning salt

## Directions:
   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rinse and wash turkey. Discard the giblets, or add to pan if they are anyone's favorites.
   2. Place turkey in a Dutch oven or roasting pan. Separate the skin over the breast to make little pockets. Put 3 tablespoons of the butter on both sides between the skin and breast meat. This makes for very juicy breast meat.
   3. In a medium bowl, combine the water with the bouillon. Sprinkle in the parsley and minced onion. Pour over the top of the turkey. Sprinkle seasoning salt over the turkey.
   4. Cover with foil, and bake in the preheated oven 3 1/2 to 4 hours, until the internal temperature of the turkey reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). For the last 45 minutes or so, remove the foil so the turkey will brown nicely.
