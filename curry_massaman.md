Thai Massaman Beef Curry


This Thai Massaman Beef Curry Recipe is sumptuous and very flavorful! It's a homemade recipe 
with no need for any store-bought curry paste or powder. The ingredients list may seem long, 
but the sauce is quite easy to make - you don't even need a food processor. Just toss all sauce 
ingredients into the curry pot as you prepare them, and simmer together with the meat. Note that 
lamb and chicken are often traditionally substituted for beef, and that both meats make for a 
delicious massaman curry. Also note that bay leaves are normally used in massaman curry rather 
than the harder-to-find kaffir lime leaves. ENJOY!

Preparation:

1. Place stock in a large pot over high heat. Add the meat, onion and bay leaves. If using fresh lemongrass, also 
add the upper leftover stalk pieces. Bring to a boil, reduce to low, until you get a nice simmer. Cover or partially-cover with a lid and simmer 40 to 80 minutes, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender or near-tender (Note: you can also choose to skip this step - see note below recipe).
2. Add all 'curry sauce' ingredients, stirring with each addition. If desired, hold back a few tablespoons of the coconut milk for serving. Also add the potatoes. Return to a boil, then continue simmering 30 more minutes or until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally.
3. Taste-test the curry, adding more fish sauce for increased flavor/saltiness, or more chili if you want it spicier. If too sour, add a little more sugar. If too salty or sweet for your taste, add a touch more tamarind or lime juice. If too spicy, add more coconut milk (regular dairy cream or homo milk will work too).
4. Transfer to a serving bowl, or plate up on individual plates or bowls. Top with fresh coriander or basil plus some additional nuts if desired. Drizzle over reserved coconut milk (if desired), and serve with Thai jasmine rice. ENJOY!

Time-Saving Tip: In this recipe I have chosen to pre-boil the meat for more tenderness - it takes longer, but I find the resulting taste worth it. However, if you're in a hurry, you can easily cut back on this step (if simmering meat 30 minutes or less, leave off lid or reduce stock to 2 cups).
