Swedish Meatballs

    Meatballs:
- 2lbs Meat: use beef, pork or veal
- 2eggs
- 1cup milk, cream, meat broth or water
- 12 cup all-purpose flour OR 1/2 cup fine bread crumbs OR 1 cup torn bread OR 1 cup mashed potatoes
        salt to taste (1.5 t sugg.)
        pepper to taste ( 1/2 t suggested)
        [ Option 1:
- 1minced onion
- 14 tsp dry mustard or 1/4 teaspoon allspice ]
        [ Option 2:
- 14 tsp dry mustard
- 18 t ground nutmeg ]
By hand or on medium speed with an electric mixture, thoroughly blend the ground meat, filler, salt and pepper, and other flavorings.  Beat until very well mixed.   Form into balls about 3/4"-1 1/2"  in diameter: do this by hand, or use a tablespoon-sized cookie scoop, or a melon baller. Makes 30-150 meatballs depending on how large they are.  Serves 6-8, more on the smörgåsbord.

Cooking methods:

Pan-fried: Heat a skillet with 2-3 tablespooons of cooking oil to medium-high heat. Fill the skillet about half full with the meatballs, and fry them for about 10 minutes.  Shake the skillet gently during cooking to keep the meatballs turning and to cook them evenly, about 10-15 minutes depending on size.  You may need a spatula to encourage some of the more stubborn meatballs to turn over properly.  As soon as meatballs are browned, take them out of the pan, let them cool and drain a bit, and keep them warm (try using an oven-proof dish in a barely-warm oven) until ready to add sauce and serve.

Oven-fried: Use ungreased baking sheets -- the kind with rims on all four sides. Separate the meatballs slightly, bake at 450F for 10-15 minutes.  Remove carefully from the baking sheets..

For most sauces, you'll stir the meatballs into the sauce then transfer them to the serving dish.  Meatballs can be prepared ahead, and refrigerated in a covered container for 2-3 days or frozen in airtight containers for several months.  You can freeze cooled meatballs spread out on a clean, cool baking sheet, then transfer them to airtight containers, if you want to be able to make a large quantity of meatballs and remove just enough at one time.  Thawed or refrigerated meatballs should be heated in a single layer on an ungreased rimmed baking sheet for 10-15 minutes at 375F.

Brown sauce or red wine sauce or sherry sauce:

- 2tablespoons pan fat
- 2tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1cup beef broth (may be made from bouillon) or 1 can condensed beef broth
- 12 - 3/4 cup water (to taste)
- 3tablespoons red wine or sherry (optional)

Add the flour to the pan fat in a saucepan, mix thoroughly.  Discard the rest of the fat from the cooking pan, then rinse the pan in some of the broth to loosen the bits of meat from the pan.  Add the broth to the fat/flour base in the saucepan.   (Tip: at this point, mixing the flour/fat mixture and the broth mixture in the blender removes all lumps thoroughly.) Heating this mixture, slowly add the water to taste.  Bring to a boil.   (Add  red wine or sherry if desired at this point.)

Sour cream sauce or Gjetost sauce:

- 1cup sour cream
- 12 cup shredded gjetost

    Transfer the meatballs to the serving dish. Discard the fat from the cooking pan, stir the sour cream into the pan to pick up the rest of the pan drippings and the bits of meat. Heat slightly, do not boil.  Stir in the shredded cheese if desired. Pour hot mixture over the meat.

White sauce:
- 2tablespoons butter
- 2tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 11/2 cup half and half or cream
- 12 cup water or chicken broth (may be made from bouillon)
    Fresh dill leaves or parsley leaves
    paprika

    Add the flour to the butter in a saucepan, mix thoroughly, turn on heat to low heat.   Discard the fat from the cooking pan, then rinse the pan in the water or broth to loosen the bits of meat from the pan.  Add the water or broth to the butter/flour base in the saucepan and mix thoroughly.  (Tip: at this point, mixing the flour/fat mixture and the broth mixture in the blender removes all lumps thoroughly.) Turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to low, and add the half and half or cream slowly.   Simmer until a good consistency.  Add dill or parsley if desired.  Stir the meatballs into the sauce until heated through.  Transfer to the serving dish and serve immediately.
