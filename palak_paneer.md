Directions

Transfer tomato mixture to a blender; add spinach. Blend until reaches a thick, smooth paste, thinning with a few teaspoons water if needed.

Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add coriander, cumin, chile powder, and turmeric; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add spinach paste; cook over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add Â½ cup water; cook, 5 minutes more. Season with salt.

Add paneer, stir to coat, and cook 5 minutes. Add cream and garam masala; stir and cook over low heat for 2 minutes. Garnish servings with pepper flakes.
