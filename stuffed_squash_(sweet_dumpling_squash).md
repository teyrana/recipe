Stuffed Sweet Dumpling Squash
Serves 3

NOTE: put in chicken, somewhere...

3 sweet dumpling squashes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, diced (about 1/2 cup)
1/4 cup nuts, coarsely chopped 
1 C (apples? oranges?)
1 T lemon zest
1 T cinnamon
1 cup cooked rice
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 375 F.

Cut squash in half and scoop out seeds. (The seeds can be roasted like pumpkin seeds.)

Place squash face-down in an oiled baking dish. Bake until tender when pierced with 
a knife, about 30 minutes. Remove squash from oven but keep oven on.

Prepare the stuffing while the squash is baking. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over 
medium heat. Add onions and saut until onion is translucent. Add pistachios, dates, 
lemon zest, and cinnamon and saut for another minute. Stir in the cooked quinoa and 
season to taste with salt and pepper.

Turn the squash upright in the baking dish and stuff with the quinoa mixture.

Cover dish with aluminum foil and bake for another 20 minutes.

Serve warm, garnished with extra pistachios or lemon zest, if desired. The peel of 
sweet dumpling squash is generally tender enough to be eaten.
