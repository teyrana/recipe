	salt 
- 2cups all-purpose flour 
- 3slices bread

Directions    
- 1The day before, boil potatoes with the skins on until tender. Cook enough to make at least 6 cups cold riced potatoes. Peel the potatoes, and rice them. Refrigerate them until needed. 
- 2Brown 2 to 3 pieces of bread in butter or margarine for croutons. Cut into small pieces, and let cool. 
- 3Combine riced potatoes, 5 or 6 beaten eggs, salt, and flour. Add croutons, and mix together. The mixture should stick together. Too much flour will make them heavy. 
- 4Form into balls about the size of tennis balls. Drop into boiling water in a large pot. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Serve immediately.
